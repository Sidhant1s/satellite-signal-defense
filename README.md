# Passive Satellite Signal Defense and Triangulation System (PSSDTS)

This repository contains a white paper detailing a conceptual defense framework titled **"Passive Satellite Signal Defense and Triangulation System (PSSDTS)"**, developed by **Sidhant Negi**. The goal is to proactively detect, localize, and track unauthorized or foreign satellite transmissions using passive radar arrays, frequency tagging, signal triangulation, and AI-based anomaly detection.

## üìÑ White Paper Summary

- **Title**: Passive Satellite Signal Defense and Triangulation System for National Signal Security
- **Author**: Sidhant Negi
- **Scope**: Detection of quantum, encrypted, and frequency-hopping signals; triangulation of unauthorized satellite communication
- **Applications**: National defense, strategic communication security, stealth aircraft detection, and space sovereignty

## üõ∞Ô∏è Core Components

- Frequency-agnostic passive radar array
- Triangulation of sender/receiver without requiring signal response
- AI-based signal fingerprinting and anomaly detection
- National radar grid integration for electromagnetic surveillance
- Capability to expose stealth aerial systems and satellite-originated attacks

## üîê Status of Submission

A message summarizing the concept was sent to the **official PMO India Instagram account**.
