# Passive Satellite Signal Defense and Triangulation System (PSSDTS)

This repository contains the concept paper for a proposed national defense system focused on detecting, classifying, and triangulating unauthorized satellite signals using passive methods. It combines long-range radar integration, signal fingerprinting, and AI-assisted triangulation to protect national airspace and communication channels.

## üìå Purpose

The project proposes a passive defense architecture capable of:

- Detecting stealth communication from enemy satellites
- Triangulating the origin of encrypted or quantum-layer signals
- Supporting space-based and ground-based national defense grids

It aims to serve as a forward-looking security measure in an era of rising satellite espionage and quantum communication threats.
